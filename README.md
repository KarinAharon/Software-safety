In this project there are two parts. The first is in JAVA and the second is in C.
In the part of JAVA I actually demonstrate 2 problems in writing a program using files:
1.null pointer exception
2.using null in case where an object is required
In the part of C I demonstrate, using 4 functions, the use of the fsanitize tool which is used to perceive problems in the code such as division by zero, ×¦emory leaka and more.
This tool helps us to detect errors on run-time.
